## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interested in applying the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) process with a real world scenario which I chose the Airbnb data of Boston, Massachusetts, United States which was compiled on 17 November 2018 since I am familiar with the area.

Below are questions that I would like to better understand about Boston's Airbnb listings:

1. Which areas in Boston have the most number of Airbnb listings and what is their median listing price?
2. Which areas are the most cost effective listings?
3. When should I start booking?



## File Descriptions

The [airbnb_boston_2018](./airbnb_boston_2018.ipynb) notebook contains all steps in this process and markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

Data used in this notebook are "listings.csv", "calendar.csv", "neighbourhoods.csv", and they are not included in this project but you can download them from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html and search for data of Boston, Massachusetts, United States that was compiled on 17 November 2018.


## Results
