## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interested in applying the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) process with a real world scenario which I chose the Airbnb data of Boston, Massachusetts, United States which was compiled on 17 November 2018 since I am familiar with the area.

Below are questions that I would like to better understand about Boston's Airbnb listings:

1. Which areas in Boston have the most number of Airbnb listings and what is their median listing price?
2. Which areas are the most cost effective listings?
3. When should I start booking?



## File Descriptions

The [airbnb_boston_2018](./airbnb_boston_2018.ipynb) notebook contains all steps in this process and markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.


## Results 

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@nongnoochroongpiboonsopit/what-will-you-see-in-airbnb-when-planning-for-your-next-trip-to-boston-d9b4b99d939a).
